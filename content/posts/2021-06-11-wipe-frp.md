Boot into a **custom recovery**, bootloader must be unlocked.
I used LineageOS recovery for Xperia XZ Compact.
Must be **root**.

```
$ getprop ro.frp.pst
/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/frp
$ blockdev --getsize64 /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/frp
```
Gives size in bytes, e.g. `50000`

Insert that size as `count` argument and set block size (`bs`) to 1 for 1 byte.

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/frp bs=1 count=50000
```

**NOTE:** `dd` is called "Disk Destroyer" as a joke, but keep in mind you might
irrecoverably brick your device by doing these steps incorrectly!
